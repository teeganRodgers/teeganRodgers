Hi, I'm Teegan! üëã
I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Austin with a strong passion for cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. I enjoy building practical applications and exploring the intersection of software development and network security.

Below are some of the projects I've been working on.

üìö Academic Projects
These are projects I completed as part of my core Computer Science curriculum at UT Austin.

Graph Pathfinding Algorithms (Java)

An implementation of BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in weighted and unweighted graphs. This project demonstrates a practical understanding of core data structures and algorithms used in AI and network routing.

Recursive Grammar Solver (Java)

A program that uses recursive backtracking to generate random sentences from a formal grammar, showcasing the ability to solve complex problems with recursive logic and data structures like maps.

üöÄ Personal Projects
These are projects I've built in my own time to explore new technologies and challenge myself.

Full-Stack Note-Taking Web App

A full-stack web application built from scratch with Python, Flask, and SQLite. It features secure user authentication and allows users to create, manage, and delete their own private notes.

Basic Pixel Monitor Bot

A Python automation script that plays a web-based reaction time game. It achieves superhuman scores by programmatically monitoring on-screen pixel color changes and triggering an instant mouse click.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills
Languages: Java, Python, C (learning), HTML/CSS, JavaScript

Developer Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Linux/Windows Terminal, SSH

Areas of Interest: Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Full-Stack Development
