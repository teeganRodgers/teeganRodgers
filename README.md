<h1>Hi, I'm Teegan! üëã</h1>
<p>
I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Austin with a strong passion for cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. I enjoy building practical applications and exploring the intersection of software development and network security.
<br>
Below are some of the projects I've been working on.
</p>

<h2>üìö Academic Projects:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b><a href="[https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/teeganRodgers/graph-pathfinding-java](https://github.com/teeganRodgers/Graph-Algorithms-Implementing-BFS-and-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm)">Graph Pathfinding Algorithms (Java)</a></b>
<br>
<i>An implementation of BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in weighted and unweighted graphs. This project demonstrates a practical understanding of core data structures and algorithms used in AI and network routing.</i>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/teeganRodgers/recursive-grammar-solver-java">Recursive Grammar Solver (Java)</a></b>
<br>
<i>A program that uses recursive backtracking to generate random sentences from a formal grammar, showcasing the ability to solve complex problems with recursive logic and data structures like maps.</i>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>üöÄ Personal Projects:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b><a href="[https://github.com/teeganRodgers/Note-Taking-Web-App](https://github.com/teeganRodgers/Note-Taking-Web-App)">Full-Stack Note-Taking Web App</a></b>
<br>
<i>A full-stack web application built from scratch with Python, Flask, and SQLite. It features secure user authentication and allows users to create, manage, and delete their own private notes.</i>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b><a href="[https://github.com/teeganRodgers/Basic-Pixel-Monitor-Bot](https://github.com/teeganRodgers/Basic-Pixel-Monitor-Bot)">Basic Pixel Monitor Bot</a></b>
<br>
<i>A Python automation script that plays a web-based reaction time game. It achieves superhuman scores by programmatically monitoring on-screen pixel color changes and triggering an instant mouse click.</i>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Languages:</b> Java, Python, C (learning), HTML/CSS, JavaScript</li>
<li><b>Developer Tools:</b> Git, GitHub, VS Code, Linux/Windows Terminal, SSH</li>
<li><b>Areas of Interest:</b> Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Full-Stack Development</li>
</ul>
